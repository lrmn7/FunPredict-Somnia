      question: "What is FunPredict and how does it work?",
      answer: "FunPredict is a decentralized prediction market platform where users can create markets, stake tokens on outcomes they believe will happen, and earn rewards when their predictions are correct. All transactions are secured by smart contracts on the blockchain."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I start making predictions?",
      answer: "Simply connect your wallet, browse active markets, and stake your tokens on the outcome you believe will occur. Once the event concludes and the outcome is verified, winners automatically receive their proportional share of the total pool."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my investment safe on FunPredict?",
      answer: "Yes! All funds are secured by audited smart contracts on the blockchain. We use industry-leading security practices, and our platform has been thoroughly tested. Your assets remain in your control until you decide to stake them."
    },
    {
      question: "What tokens can I use for predictions?",
      answer: "FunPredict uses SOMI, the native token of the Somnia Network, for all prediction markets. Each prediction is placed using SOMI, and rewards are settled in the same token."
    },
    {
      question: "How are market outcomes determined?",
      answer: "Market outcomes are determined through a decentralized oracle system and community verification. Once an event concludes, the outcome is verified through multiple sources to ensure accuracy and fairness."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I create my own prediction market?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Any user can create a prediction market. Simply navigate to the 'Create' section, define your event question, set the parameters, and launch your market. You'll earn fees from participants who join your market."
